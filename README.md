* post data should be a component

Extra points:

* a global state to store components and posts
* add a landing page listing all posts
* pagination on landing page
* to be fast rendering all posts, when in the landing page should fetch posts and save in the global store
* placeholders for all components
* 404 Not Found page with an invalid URL path
